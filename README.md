## Project Description: Stopwatch Application
I created this project to track wasted time. The timer operates using localStorage, allowing you to close the browser and reopen the stopwatch the next day without losing any progress.
List of recorded timers and comment user can edit in localStorage.
Feel free to copy it to your local machine.

### Overview
The Stopwatch Application is a simple yet effective tool designed to help users track time with a user-friendly interface. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application provides various functionalities including starting, pausing, resetting the timer, and saving the recorded times to local storage. The saved data can be viewed along with user comments, making this app not just a stopwatch but a time logging tool.

### Features
1. **Start, Pause, and Reset Functionality**:
   - Users can initiate timing by clicking the "Start" button, pause it using the "Pause" button, and reset the timer with the "Reset" button.
   - A confirmation dialog prompts the user when resetting to ensure they truly wish to reset the timer.

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - The application leverages local storage to save the current elapsed time and stopwatch state, allowing users to retain their data even after refreshing or closing the browser.
   - If the timer was previously running, it resumes from where it left off.

3. **Data Logging**:
   - Users can save their timing sessions with comments. Each entry, stored in local storage, includes the date, elapsed time, and the comment provided by the user.
   - An alert prompts users if the time recorded is less than 60 seconds, ensuring only meaningful data is saved.

4. **List of Recorded Times**:
   - All saved sessions can be displayed in a structured table, showing the date, the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and any commented notes.
   - The application provides an option to clear the local storage for a fresh start.
